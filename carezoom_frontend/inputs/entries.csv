Boston Medical Center (BMC) is a large safety net hospital, with 90% of the patient population enrolled in MassHealth or Medicare. 10% of the patient population has hepatitis C, much higher than the 2% hepatitis C prevalence in the United States’ general population. While some hepatitis C patients at BMC received care for hepatitis C in specialty clinics (gastrointestinal or infectious disease), a lot of patients did not receive care necessary care to treat their disease. Additionally, 340B drug pricing monetarily incentivizes medical centers to treat hepatitis C in their patient population. The Boston Medical Center Primary Care Hepatitis C Treatment Program was established in 2015 in an effort to address the specific needs of hepatitis C patients so that they can receive treatment, decreasing disease burden in the population and secondarily, financially benefit the hospital. The program consists of 13 primary care physicians (4 of whom see the majority of the patients) who have been trained in treating hepatitis C, a social worker (follows patients longitudinally, tries to help address patients’ psychosocial issues), a clinical pharmacist (provides medication teaching to patients), and a pharmacist technician (works to obtain prior authorization for hepatitis C medication). ","The Boston Medical Center Primary Care Hepatitis C Treatment Program’s no show rate (# missed appointments/total # appointments scheduled) was 40% during its first few years, much higher than the 25% no show rate hospital-wide. The program director decided an intervention was necessary to get patients to attend the appointments necessary to treat their disease. The team considered QI projects around patient navigation and case management, but they felt the social worker was providing these services well. The social worker mentioned that patients had reported not coming to clinic for financial reasons (unable to miss work, issues with transportation, no childcare available). They decided to try a monetary incentive program. While this has not been implemented for hepatitis C treatment, it has been shown to be effective in care for HIV, substance use disorder, and smoking cessation. They received a grant from the Boston University Center for Implementation and Improvement Science for a pilot project providing $15 gift cards to patients who attend their scheduled appointments with physicians. They decided to forego a randomized control trial and provide gift cards to all patients who attended physician appointments for ethical reasons. They chose to conduct the pilot from April through June, as there would be fewer weather problems and holidays to inhibit attendance.  They also consulted the BMC legal team, who advised them that it was legal to provide monetary incentives to patients to promote access to care and that hospital policy stipulated the maximum amount to give is $15 per visit and $75 annually. Data collection was key to this intervention. A research assistant was hired to collect and analyze the data during the pilot, as well as assist the team in conducting interviews with both hospital stakeholders to learn their thoughts on the sustainability, feasibility, ethics, and acceptability of the intervention and also patients to hear about their experience with the intervention.","The typical hepatitis C clinic workflow: Patients initially are identified as hepatitis C patients in the BMC emergency department or specialty clinic. Once they are diagnosed, the team social worker is made aware and contacts patients to set up an appointment with a hepatitis C provider. They see a physician for an initial evaluation, during which mode of disease contraction, potential treatment, and level of motivation for treatment are discussed. They then receive outpatient testing to evaluate extent of disease (ultrasound and fibroscan of the liver), and they subsequently return to clinic to discuss test results and make the decision whether or not to treat. Typically, it takes a week or two for prior authorization to be approved (since 2016, all patients have been approved), at which time the patient meets with the clinical pharmacist to receive education around taking the drug and potential side effects/interactions, a calendar of treatment, and a prescription to receive the medication (if getting medication through BMC pharmacy, they receive their first bottle at the appointment). The clinical pharmacist calls the patient at week 2 and sees the patient in clinic at week 4 to take labs. 3 months after treatment, patients come to see the physician to check for cure and receive more education. The financial incentive pilot workflow: The social worker contacts the patient to set up an appointment with a physician and tells the patient that he or she will receive a $15 gift card at the appointment. When the patient arrives at the appointment, the physician gives the patient the gift card. For patients not seeing one of the four main hepatitis C physicians, the social worker gives the patient the gift card. Providing the gift card is included in the patient’s chart. Note: not all patients scheduled their appointments with the social worker, so a portion of patients who received the gift card at the appointment were unaware of it prior to attending the appointment.",""h","The pilot costed $14,000. This included $5,000 for the cost of the gift cards, the salary of a research assistant (helps with submitting paperwork, collecting and analyzing data).","The key outcome was clinic attendance rate (# appointments attended/total # appointments schedules) for physician visits in the Boston Medical Center Primary Care Hepatitis C Treatment Program. 198 patients were scheduled for visits during this intervention. Data analysis showed that patient attendance increased from 61% in April-June 2016 to 73% in April-June 2017 with the incentive, (78% if only counting patients informed of the incentive by the social worker in the analysis). More complex analysis was also performed. A logistic regression, controlling for age, sex, race, and insurance type, showed that odds of a patient attending a visit during the intervention in 2017 was 2.05 times the odds of a patient attending a visit during the same 3-month period in 2016 (CI 1.25-3.36, p=0.005). An interrupted time series analysis was also performed and showed that the effect of the intervention was independent of larger trends over the study period.
